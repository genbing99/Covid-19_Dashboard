# Covid-19 Dashboard

## Introduction
The Covid-19 outbreak, which was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019, has spread to many countries outside mainland China. As the pandemic has spread across the globe, the virus has left a trail of deaths in its wake. The recent spikes of Covid-19 cases have inspired us to create a dashboard to visualize the trends of various locations in a timely manner. We intend to create a dashboard to better identify the hotspots and compare trends in different locations.

In this project, we downloaded the dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data, which is the official Covid-19 dataset that maintained by Our World in Data. The data is updated daily and records the latest situation worldwide. The dataset downloaded contains the data from 1 January 2020 to 30 January 2021.
